# rock-paper-scissors

This program allows a user to play a five round match of rock, paper, scissor against a computer opponent.

The winner of the match will be declared after all rounds have completed.

To run this program, clone or fork the repository, start a web server of your choice (I recommend using live server in Visual Studio Code), and open the rock-paper-scissors.html file.

Once the page loads, you'll be prompted to enter rock, paper, or scissor. The prompt is case insensitive. To see the results of each round as well
as the match result, make sure you have developer tools opened in your browser with the console in view.
